Graph learning has been shown as an efficient method for recommendation tasks [reference].

### How it works?
Machine learning tasks can be performed on graph data by learning representations of the nodes. The learnt representations of nodes can encode the information of the structure ofthe graph and be easily used for other machine learning tasks such as link predictions, node classification and recommendations.

The basic idea behind Graph neural netowrk is to use a neural network to learn the vector representation of nodes (or/and edges) so that structurally similar nodes in the graph will have similar vector representations.
