Summary
======
Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry (expecting to graduate in Nov. 2020). Expertise in applying machine learning techniques and cheminformatics to solve chemistry problems, e.g., QSAR modeling. Well-versed in programming languages Python and R and machine learning toolkits such as PyTorch and Scikit-Learn. Proficient skills in chemical data mining, curation, analysis, visualization, and modeling. 

Research Interests
======
* Cheminformatics
* QSAR/QSPR Modeling
* Molecular Representation Learning (SMILES-based and Graph-based approaches)
* Machine Learning/Deep Learning
* Big Data Mining, Curation, Analysis, Visulzation and Modeling
* Virtual Screening
* Natural Language Processing

Research
======

* Development of Novel Quantitative Structure-Property/Activity Relationship (QSPR/QSAR) Modeling Methodologies:
    * MolPMoFiT: An inductive transfer learning method for QSRR/QSAR modeling. MolPMoFiT pre-trained a universal molecular structure prediction model using one million bioactive molecules from ChEMBL and then fine-tuned it for various QSPR/QSAR tasks. 
    * Hierarchical QSAR: An effective ensemble modeling method that Integrating binary/multi classification and regression models for predicting acute oral systemic toxicity.


* Python packages:
    * SMILES Pair Encoding (SPE): a data-driven substructure tokenization algorithm for deep learning.
    * Molecular DataSets (MolDS): A toolkit (Python Package) for curating, standardizing and diagnosing Molecular Data Sets for benchmarking machine learning methods.


* Software Development:
    * CryptoChem:  A novel cryptographic and data storage method based on cheminformatics, machine learning, and big chemical data. Two independent software were developed: MOLWRITE and MOLREAD. MOLWRITE encrypts the text/image data into chemical message and MOLREAD decrypts the encoded chemical message back to text/image.
